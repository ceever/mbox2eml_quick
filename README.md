# mbox2eml_quick

**A quick and dirty eml extractor for (thunderbird) mbox files (also finds hidden emails in mbox)**

(Partiularly for cases where emails are not displayed in Thunderbird anymore, but still contained in the mbox file!)

This might not work on all mbox files, but it works on mbox files where each email starts with "From " (space required!). This seems to be the case for Thunderbird mbox files.

Particularly this program help to extract email which are not displayed in Thunderbird anymore but still stored inside the mbox file. This can be useful if you loose your files somehow but discover that your mbox files are still huge. I.e. they are just hidden but still exist.

Note, the easiest way to make sure all emails have been copied to emls is to compare the sizes of the original mbox file and the extracted emls.
